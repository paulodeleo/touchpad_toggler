Simple shell script to enable / disable the touchpad of Dell Latitude E5410 (Brazilian model) notebooks.

Every time it is executed, it toggles the touchpad on / off.

Great to bind to a global hotkey. I use it with win/super/mod+F5 (any hint on how to use FN key on custom shortcuts?).

Tested with Ubuntu 11.10 64bit, but it should work with any Debian based linux, if not all.

Almost fully based on the script posted as an answer by Martin Wallgren here:

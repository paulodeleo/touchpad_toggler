{"body":"**Simple shell script to enable / disable the touchpad of Dell Latitude E5410 (Brazilian model) notebooks.**\r\n**Also compatible with CCE Win T33L notebooks (cce branch).**\r\n\r\nEvery time it is executed, it toggles the touchpad on / off.\r\n\r\nGreat to bind to a global hotkey. I use it with win/super/mod+F5 (any hint on how to use FN key on custom shortcuts?).\r\n\r\nTested with Ubuntu 11.10 64bit, but it should work with any Debian based linux, if not all.\r\n\r\nAlmost fully based on the script posted as an answer by Martin Wallgren here:\r\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/14178/how-to-disable-touchpad-on-dell-latitude-e-series-e5510-e6510\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"UA-31619226-2","tagline":"Touchpad toggler shell script for Dell Latitude E5410 (Brazilian model) notebooks","note":"Don't delete this file!
